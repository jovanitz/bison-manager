# AI context — Sensors (feedback controls)

**Sensors** are the harness's _feedback_ controls: checks that observe output and
return a result the agent can act on. They are the counterpart to **Guides** (the
feedforward docs/rules). For the concepts and vocabulary, read
[harness.md](harness.md) first.

All sensors are **computational** (deterministic, ms–seconds) and print **JSON** to
stdout, so the model can parse the result and chain decisions. The logic lives once
in `scripts/harness/sensors/`; the CLI, skills, and hooks are just _surfaces_ over
it — none re-implement it.

> Convention: run the sensor, read the JSON, act on it. Don't eyeball raw logs.

> **Test levels:** two sensors cover three levels. `quality` runs **unit +
> integration**, both _simulated_ (Node/jsdom/happy-dom, in-memory adapters — no
> browser, no DB, no network); `e2e` runs the **real-browser** level (Chromium +
> running app). The full taxonomy and the simulated↔real line live in

## When to reach for which

- **Before declaring done** → `quality`. Non-negotiable. (Also enforced as a
  guardrail by the Stop hook, which runs it with `--build` to match CI — see
  [harness.md](harness.md).)
- **Before a risky refactor / to scope which projects to test** → `impact`
  (project level — this is what the gate runs).
- **Before changing a shared symbol's signature / to focus review** → `consumers`
  (file level — exactly which files import what you changed, direct + transitive).
  Complements `impact`; it does not drive the gate.
- **After touching domain/application hot paths or adding a screen** → `perf`.
- **What's missing / TDD gate** → `gaps`. Blocks the Stop hook & CI on a
  high-severity gap (untested use case or adapter) — this is the TDD enforcement.
  Uniquely cheap here: because ports are types, an adapter with no contract test
  is a _mechanically detectable_ gap. Silence intentional ones via
  `scripts/harness/harness-ignore.json` or an inline `// harness-ignore`.
- **To keep files small / folders organized** → `structure` (also part of the
  Stop guardrail). See [structure.md](structure.md).
- **Suspect a circular import** → `cycles` (also part of the Stop guardrail).
- **Auditing unused/orphaned code** → `dead-code` (knip; finds what nothing imports).
- **Checking the core stays well-tested** → `coverage` (domain/application floor;
  enforced in CI — slower, so not in the local Stop hook).
- **Proving a pure rule holds for ALL inputs (auth policy, coherence guards)** →
  `formal` (property-based + exhaustive model-check; the automated backstop for
  the logic-level auth flaws `/security-review` reviews by hand). Sub-second.
- **After touching the harness / before starting real work** → `doctor`.

> computational sensors above won't help — use the built-in `/security-review`

## Where each runs

- **Local Stop hook (guardrail, blocks "done")**: `quality` (+build), `structure`,
  `cycles`, `gaps` (TDD gate — no untested use case/adapter).
- **CI (blocks merge)**: the Stop-hook set + `coverage`; `dead-code`, `audit`,
  `skill-scan` run **advisory** (visible, non-blocking — security baseline to
  promote to blocking once the tree is clean).
- **On-demand only**: `impact`, `consumers`, `perf`, `runtime-advice`, `doctor`.
- **Security**: `audit` = dependency CVEs (software supply chain); `skill-scan` =
  agent surface (skills/MCP). Complement `/security-review` (app-code semantics).
  See [security.md](security.md).
- **Runtime validation (opt-in, only when e2e earns its cost)**: `e2e`. The Stop
  hook decides _when to nudge_ via `runtime-advice`: if the diff touches a **faked
  seam** (a composition root, the app-shell/router — see `harness.config.mjs`
  `runtimeSeams`) it **nudges (non-blocking)**; a change confined to
  domain/application/pure-UI gets no nudge. You can also mark a task explicitly
  (`.harness/require-e2e`); a passing `e2e` clears it. See the **verify-runtime**
  skill, the criterion in
  [methodology.md](methodology.md#when-does-e2e-earn-its-cost-dont-pay-it-by-default),
  and [workflow.md](workflow.md) step 9.
- **Backend e2e (heavy, Docker)**: `e2e-auth` boots the real local Supabase + API +
  all three apps and drives them for real (web login, staff dashboard sign-in,
  customer onboarding) — the only suite that exercises the live frontend↔backend
  seam. Its own config keeps the cheap web-only `e2e` Docker-free.
- **CI**: both run as dedicated jobs in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — `e2e`
  (Chromium, no backend) and `e2e-auth` (installs the Supabase CLI, `supabase
start`s the Docker stack, injects the live publishable key, then runs). Separate
  from the affected gate so their cost is isolated.

## Not a sensor

- **`generate-feature`** is a **generator** — it _writes_ a feature slice from the
  `Item` template. It produces code, it doesn't observe it, so it is not a control.
  (We avoid the word "scaffold" for it; see [harness.md](harness.md).)
- Per-layer rules/patterns are **Guides**, not a sensor — read the relevant
  `libs/<layer>/CLAUDE.md` and [architecture.md](architecture.md).
